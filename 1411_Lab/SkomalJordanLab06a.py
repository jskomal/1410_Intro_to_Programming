# Description: Lab 6. This lab demonstrates various functions of String datatype


def main():
    # Python translates each character to a number. The ord() function in python
    # accepts a single character string as an argument and returns the numeric code of it.

    ch = input("Please enter a single character: ")
    value = ord(ch)
    print("The numeric representation of", ch, "is", value)

    # The chr() function does the reverse. chr() function takes a integer number
    # as an argument and returns the equivalent character.

    print("The equivalent character of the number", value, "is", chr(value))

    # The following piece of code will take a string as input and it will convert
    # each of the character as a sequence of numbers (separated by whitespace)

    txt = input("Please enter a text: ")
    for ch in txt:
        print(ord(ch), end=" ")

    # split function splits a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.

    txt1 = input("\nPlease enter a string with space: ")
    listSubStrings = txt1.split(" ")
    print(listSubStrings)

    # join function joins the list of strings into one string using a delimiter

    newString = "-".join(listSubStrings)
    print(newString)
